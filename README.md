This project shows a Python-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) system that does both spelling correction and next-word prediction based on deep learning methods. It is powered by the pyspellchecker library for autocorrection and a TensorFlow LSTM model for sequence prediction, and it provides a clean yet effective example of how neural networks can be used to improve old-fashioned text correction.

The autocorrect module identifies and corrects spelling errors in input sentences to provide accurate text prior to prediction. In the meantime, the LSTM model is trained over a small bespoke corpus to predict the next most probable word in a sentence, mimicking the functionality of contemporary predictive text systems. The strategy underscores the coexistence of rule-based and neural network-based NLP approaches.

The notebook has preprocessing tasks like tokenization, sequence generation, and model training with Keras layers like Embedding, LSTM, and Dense. It offers a simple, practical guide on how text data is prepared, a model is constructed, and predictions are assessed. The system generates corrected and contextually appropriate text, thus it is beneficial for educational demonstrations, language modeling, or simple chatbot foundations.

To execute the project, install the packages (tensorflow, pyspellchecker, numpy) and run the Jupyter Notebook file Untitled1.ipynb. The notebook takes each step — from text correction to training of the neural model and prediction — step by step. Example inputs like "I lvoe learnng new thngs" are corrected automatically to "I love learning new things," highlighting its efficiency.

This project is designed for developers, students, and researchers interested in learning the concepts of NLP preprocessing and recurrent neural networks. Potential future enhancements might involve training on greater datasets, the inclusion of pretrained embeddings such as GloVe or Word2Vec, or deployment in a web or CLI environment. The code itself is open source under the MIT License, with an invitation to experiment and further improve.
